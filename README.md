## Hello!
Today I have created a website which name is Classic Car House. To complete this website I have used some technologies and I am going to say about the website and building technology for UI, Functionality. For the Authentication setup, I have used the firebase system. So I try to handle cover car-related services.

Admin Login: admin@admin.com </br>

## Actually, This is a Car House website where someone can get--
1. This website lets you know about car buy-sell-related booking services, test drives, & customer feedback with ratings. Having an admin panel allows you to easily control everything from the website's dashboard.
2. This website is built with mobile responsiveness so that you can easily see every page of the website very well.
3. This website uses a Google authentication system so that your users will always be safe as well as provide special security.
4. The dashboard of this website is divided into two sections, users will be able to see only its reviews and order and admins will be able to see everything together with all user reviews and product management.
5. Used to build the website is a combination of react-bootstrap and node.js, which makes the website's loading speed very fast and user-friendly.

## I have also used some technologies for creating the website.--
- For Frontend UI I have used React js technology
- Tailwind CSS for framework & Custom CSS3
- React Router Dom for Routing
- Firebase Authentication System
- Node.js, MongoDB, Heroku
- FontAwesome Icon
- Firebase Hosting
